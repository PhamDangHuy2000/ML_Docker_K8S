## Introduction

The Recommender System is designed to suggest products to users based on their preferences and historical data. Utilizing the Nearest Neighbors algorithm from Scikit-learn, the system provides accurate and personalized recommendations. The project is deployed using Docker containers, managed and scaled with Kubernetes.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, and manage user profiles.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and manage product listings.
- **Product Recommendations**: Provide tailored product suggestions based on user data.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Utilize Docker for consistent and scalable deployments.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Manage application scaling and availability with Kubernetes.

## Architecture

The Recommender System is composed of the following components:

- **Flask Application**: A Python web application framework for managing users and products and displaying recommendations.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A robust relational database system for storing user and product data.
- **Machine Learning**: Integration with Scikit-learn to implement the Nearest Neighbors algorithm for product recommendations.
- **Docker**: Containerization of application components for portability and consistency.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration of Docker containers for high availability and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

+   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
+   cd repository
1. **Build Docker Images**
+   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/flask:latest -f Dockerfile .
+   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/postgres:latest -f postgres/Dockerfile .

1. **Push Docker Images to Docker Hub**
+   docker push your-dockerhub-username/flask:latest
+   docker push your-dockerhub-username/postgres:latest


## Deployment
- Deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster:

1. **Apply Kubernetes Manifests**
- kubectl apply -f kubernetes/flask-deployment.yaml
- kubectl apply -f kubernetes/postgres-deployment.yaml
- kubectl apply -f kubernetes/flask-service.yaml
- kubectl apply -f kubernetes/postgres-service.yaml
- kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ingress.yaml
  
+   Ensure that all resources are created successfully:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl get ingress
2. **Verify Deployments**
- Check the status of the pods to ensure they are running:
kubectl get pods
- You should see output indicating that the Flask and PostgreSQL pods are running.
3. **Access the Application**
-   Open your browser and navigate to the domain specified in your Ingress resource, e.g., `http://your-app-domain.com/`.
## Usage
1. **Access the Application**
